# Bank Marketing Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that focuses on data cleaning and exploratory analysis using the Bank Marketing Dataset.
The goal is to prepare a reliable and well-structured dataset suitable for analytical dashboards and further modeling.

## Project Overview

The notebook documents the process of inspecting, cleaning, and transforming raw campaign data collected by a bank’s marketing team.
The project aims to uncover early insights on customer behavior and ensure the dataset is ready for visualization in tools such as Looker Studio or for predictive modeling.

### Objectives

* Identify and handle missing or inconsistent values.
* Standardize and encode categorical variables.
* Conduct initial exploratory analysis to reveal trends and correlations.
* Prepare a cleaned dataset for reporting and analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Inspection:** Load and assess data quality and structure.
2. **Cleaning and Transformation:** Address null values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create or modify columns for analysis readiness.
4. **Exploratory Analysis:** Examine distributions, relationships, and potential predictors of campaign success.
5. **Export:** Save the cleaned dataset for further visualization or modeling.

## Tools and Libraries

* **Python 3.9+**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** — data manipulation and cleaning
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** — visualization and exploration

## Key Insights

* Longer call durations tend to correlate with higher deposit subscription rates.
* Customers with housing loans show different behavioral patterns compared to those without loans.
* Demographic and occupational variables reveal meaningful differences in campaign outcomes.

## File Description

* **`checking_bank_two.ipynb`** — Main notebook for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
* **`Bank_Cleaned_for_Report.xlsx`** — Exported dataset ready for visualization or modeling.

## Next Steps

* Integrate the cleaned dataset into Looker Studio to build KPI dashboards.
* Develop a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of deposit subscription.
* Expand the exploratory analysis to include time-based and demographic segmentation.
